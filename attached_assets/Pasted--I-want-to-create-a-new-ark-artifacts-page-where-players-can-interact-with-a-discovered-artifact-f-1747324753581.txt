❝ I want to create a new /ark/artifacts page where players can interact with a discovered artifact from the Ark in a highly immersive, realistic way. This is a key sacred object in the narrative. It should feel like the user is uncovering, inspecting, and unlocking something ancient and powerful.

🧩 Core Features & Vision:
🔁 1. 3D Artifact Viewer
Display the artifact in full 3D — rendered in real-time

Users can:

Rotate the object (drag or mouse movement)

Zoom in/out (mouse wheel or pinch)

Click or tap on parts to trigger responses (glow, unlocks, info popups)

Artifact should be realistic in shading, texture, and shadow (hyper-realistic vibe)

Use react-three-fiber + drei + PBR materials for high fidelity

🔓 2. Interactive Unlock Mechanics
Allow user to use a specific item from their inventory (e.g., “Obsidian Key” or “Glyph Lens”) to activate or reveal hidden parts of the artifact

If the user has the required item:

Trigger an animation (panel slides, glyphs glow, parts expand)

Reveal a lore transmission, blueprint, or new crafting recipe

If they don’t have the item, display a mystical response like:

“The artifact does not recognize your energy. A key is required.”

🧬 3. Component-Based UI
Break page into clear sections:

Top bar: Artifact name, class (e.g., ARK-T3 Relic), discovered location

Main view: 3D interactive component

Sidebar (or overlay): inventory item selection to interact with artifact

Optional lore panel that slides open when something is unlocked

🪐 4. Immersive Styling
Background should resemble an ancient vault or digital relic chamber

Add ambient glow, dust, or rune shimmer effects (using Framer Motion or GLSL)

Use ancient fonts, glowing sigils, sound cues for unlocks

🛠 Tech Stack Suggestions:
react-three-fiber + @react-three/drei for 3D rendering

Framer Motion or GSAP for animation triggers

Zustand or Context API for inventory + user state

Tailwind CSS or styled-components for sacred UI

🧪 Initial Task List:
Build base layout for /ark/artifacts

Load 1 demo artifact model (e.g., .glb or .gltf) with PBR materials

Implement rotation, zoom, and part-click detection

Set up a dummy inventory with a placeholder item to trigger the unlock state

Style the page to feel like a sacred digital vault

Let me know if you need the 3D model, artifact metadata JSON, or lore unlock text. ❞
