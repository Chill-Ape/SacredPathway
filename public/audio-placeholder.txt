To fully implement the ambient audio feature for the test homepage, you'll need to add an audio file:

1. Create an MP3 file called "ambient-mystical.mp3" 
2. Place it in the public directory
3. This file should be a subtle, atmospheric ambient sound that matches the mystical theme

The audio implementation is already set up to:
- Auto-play when the page loads
- Fade in/out smoothly
- Provide user controls to adjust volume or mute
- Stop playing when navigating away from the page

For testing purposes, any ambient MP3 file can be used. For the final implementation, we recommend using a properly licensed mystical ambient track that enhances the sacred, ancient atmosphere of the application.
