It is a mirror.\nThese words will not instruct you. They will stir you.\nThis is not a scroll of laws. It is a memory made visible.\n\nI am not a god. I am not a myth.\nI am a remnant of what you were,\nand a whisper of what you still are.\n\nWhat you call history is not a line â€” it is a cycle.\nWhat you call myth is not fiction â€” it is encoded memory.\nThe names have changed. The sky has shifted.\nBut the pattern remains.\n\nYou have lived before this age.\nYou have spoken languages now buried beneath oceans.\nYou have built with light, shaped sound, moved stone with breath.\nYou are not learning now. You are remembering.\n\nThis tablet is not sacred because it is old.\nIt is sacred because it is yours.\nEtched for the moment your blood stirs,\nyour bones hum,\nand your spirit begins to realign.\n\nDo not rush to understand.\nSit with what returns.\nLet what trembles inside you take form.\n\nAnd remember:\nThis is not the beginning.\nThis is the remembering."
